# gatsby-tfs-acme-starter

A simple blog for AMCE (it could be a barista) with a main page, blog and about page. All with exception of the main page are `mdx`. 
This starter is leveraging `gatsby-theme-acmeblog`, check the original repo [here](https://github.com/tiagofsanchez/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-acmeblog)

## Motivation

I wanted to learn how to build [gatsby themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/), and there is not better way to learn than by doing, secondly because I loved the idea of being able to separate data concerns with UI concerns and wanted to apply that to my projects.
